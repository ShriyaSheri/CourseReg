3. **Course Management**: Provide faculty and administrators with tools to add, modify, or delete courses. Include options to set course capacities, prerequisites, and scheduling details.

4. **Enrolment Management**: Allow administrators to oversee course enrolments, including adding or removing students, and generating enrolment reports.

5. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle course fees and related transactions.

6. **Data Security**: Implement measures like encryption to safeguard user information.
